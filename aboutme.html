      <h3><u><b>WHY MORINGA</b></u></h3>
      <p>
          Good, I did not heard about Moringa School before but when first case of <strong><i><b>Covid-19</b></i></strong> was reported in the country, immediattely all schools shutdown unknowingly. I tried all means out to make both ends meet but was somehow a challenge on my side as therem was nothing to do and job opportunities also went down, I was like to give up but Itried all means not to. One day I woke up don't what to do but upon surveying my instangram I saw an advert of Moringa School about software development, I chose to go through the advert but I was like in a shock and had lots of questions at the back of my minds, <em><b>how can a course of software development can be taught in <strong>twenty weeks</strong></b></em> and yet people go to campus four years and come out nothing they know about software development. I decided to anquire more about it before making an application. I took some time before start feeding in the requirements after which I recieved a call in just a few minutes informing me to check my email so as to complete my application. There after my journey for joining Moringa School begun. As per now am very previlleged to be in Moringa School to persue this course <strong><i>because</i></strong>
          <ol>
              <li>Their responce.</li>
              <li>The commitment of TMs to make sure the content is covered within the speculated time, that's <strong><i>twenty weeks.</i></strong></li>
              <li>The support of thier TMs to students to make sure they move on with their studies with no interference</li>
          </ol>
