        <p>Am Rovine Wanjala, a student at Laikipia University Persuing Bachelor in Information and Communication Technologies.
           I personally love academics and also love my course because its my choice, more especially programming, writing algorithms to solve problems. Am out to work extra hard to achieve my goals, thats I'll do everything <strong>I can</strong> in my life so as to come out successfully.
           Currently at Moringa School to make a double edged sword of my programming skills. So far Moringa has made me know that nothing I know in programming, now it's sharpening me and making me a future vessel of honor pertaining programming.
